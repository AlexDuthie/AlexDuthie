## PERSONAL STATEMENT
 
I am a first year BSc software development ‘remote’ student at UHI/ IBM with existing qualifications in multiple areas of computing. I have experience using Java, JavaScript and Vue the most but only at an early university level, nothing at a large scale. I also get to dabble with dozens of IBM Cloud’s technologies provided to me by my course heads for team projects in class. My Wife and I have three children which motivates me to succeed and progress in my career. 



## RELEVANT WORK HISTORY

Student BSc ‘Junior’ Software Developer	September 2020 – Current
UHI/ IBM, Remote		

My role is full-time student but due to the applied structure of the course. I work in 2-to-3-week team projects using Agile practices, Jira boards, Jira sprints and enterprise design thinking. Each project encourages the use of different languages and technologies to give us more insight during the first year.

Key achievement: Winning 1st Place in IBM’s 2020 Call for Code ‘Spot Challenge’

IT Support Assistant (2nd Tier)	November 2011 – January 2014
CapGemini (Rolls-Royce), Nairn - Scotland		

I started as an apprentice and stayed on for just over a year. My role was to work on the desk and respond to tickets created by the 1st tier assistants or to be at the helm for calls to be escalated to me and my team. This is where I learned how to use MS Outlook efficiently due to the mass flood of emails in my inbox every morning, I managed this by creating mailing rules to sort issue types into categories.

Key achievement: Earned my SVQ Level 3 in Information Technology

* **Great communication / team player** – due to how much I enjoy collaborating with others.
* **Keen to learn** - having spent multiple years in university studying software, I must adapt to using new languages, technologies and whatever else is thrown in the mix.
* **Creative mindset** – due to spending a lot of time brainstorming ideas, writing blogs, creating content on tools such as Adobe PS and Premiere Pro. 
* **Java & JavaScript / Vue (Semi-Intermediate)** – having worked on university projects using these languages and advancing my skill with side projects, I am starting to feel quite confident and comfortable. 


## HOBBIES & INTERESTS

When I’m not working or studying, I am usually blogging or being creative somehow on the computer. I have found myself using Adobe packages such as Photoshop, After Effect and Premiere Pro a lot over the last couple years which I have an increasing interest in.

I get out with the kids and the dog every day and help them with their learning in-between mine so it there Is always something to keep me busy basically. Proper downtime though is having a cup of tea whilst playing Xbox for the last hour of the day!
